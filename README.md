# MinQueue-Object
#  Problem 

Design and implement aMinQueuedata structure that can store comparable elements and supports the queue operationsadd(x),remove(), andsize(), as well as the min() operation, which returns the minimum value currently stored in the data structure. 

All operations should run in constant amortized time.

#  Challenges 

•	Create a new MinQueue object

•	Queue to store elements

•	Deque to keep track of minimum element

•	Constructor to initialize the queue and deque

•	Method to remove the elements from the queue

•	Method to return the size of the queue
